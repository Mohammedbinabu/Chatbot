A Bill of Lading or express receipt must accompany each invoice. Payment of an invoice will not constitute Buyer#s acceptance of goods and will be subject to\\nadjustment for errors, shortages, defects in the goods or other Supplier failures to meet the requirements of this purchase order. Buyer may at any time set off any amount owed by Buyer to Supplier against any\\namount owed by Supplier or any of its affiliated companies to Buyer.\\n1.3 DISCOUNTS\\nTime in connection with any discount offered by Supplier will be computed from the latest of (i) the scheduled delivery date, (ii) the date of actual delivery, or (iii) the date an acceptable invoice is received. For the\\npurpose of earning the discount, payment will be deemed to have been made on the date Buyer initiates payment, whether by issuance of a check, wire transfer or other electronic payment method.\\n1.4 OVERSHIPMENTS\\nBuyer will pay only for maximum quantities ordered. Overshipments will be held by Buyer at Supplier\\'s risk and expense for a reasonable time awaiting shipping instructions. Return shipping charges for excess\\nquantities will be at Supplier\\'s expense.\\n1.5 PACKING AND SHIPMENT\\nUnless otherwise specified, when the price of this purchase order is based on the weight of the ordered goods, such price is to cover only the net weight of material ordered, and no charges will be allowed for\\npacking, handling, transportation, storage or other packing requirements. Unless otherwise specified, Supplier will package and pack all goods in a manner which is (i) in accordance with good commercial practice,\\n(ii) acceptable to common carriers for shipment at the lowest rate for the particular goods, (iii) in accordance with I.C.C. regulations, and (iv) adequate to insure safe arrival of the goods at the named destination.\\nSupplier will mark all containers with necessary lifting, handling, and shipping information and with purchase order numbers, date of shipment, and the names of the consignee and consignor. An itemized packing list\\nmust accompany each shipment. No partial or complete delivery will be made prior to the due date or dates shown unless Buyer has given prior written consent.\\n1.6 DELIVERY TERMS\\nUnless otherwise specifically provided on the face of this order, the products ordered will be delivered to Buyer#s facility on a DAP basis (Incoterms 2020).\\n1.7 WARRANTY\\n(a) Supplier warrants that all goods delivered (i) will be free from defects in workmanship, material, and manufacture, (ii) will comply with the requirements of this purchase order, including any drawings or\\nspecifications incorporated herein or samples furnished by Supplier, (iv) will comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, and (iv) where design is Supplier\\'s responsibility, will be free from defects in design.\\nSupplier further warrants that all goods purchased hereunder will be of merchantable quality and will be fit for Buyer#s intended purposes. The foregoing warranties constitute conditions to this purchase order. They\\nare in addition to all other warranties, whether express or implied, and will survive any delivery, inspection, acceptance or payment by Buyer. All warranties run to the benefit of Buyer and its customers.\\n(b) Buyer\\'s approval of Supplier\\'s materials or designs will not relieve Supplier of any warranties.\\n(c) If any goods delivered do not meet the warranties specified herein or otherwise applicable, Buyer may, at its option, (i) require Supplier to correct any defective or nonconforming goods by repair or replacement at\\nno cost to Buyer, or (ii) return such defective or nonconforming goods to Supplier at Supplier\\'s expense and recover from Supplier the order price thereof, or (iii) correct the defective or nonconforming goods itself\\nand charge Supplier with the cost of such correction.\\n1.8 INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE\\nNotwithstanding any prior inspection or payments, all goods will be subject to final inspection and acceptance at Buyer\\'s plant within a reasonable time after delivery. If any item is defective in material or\\nworkmanship, or otherwise not in conformity with the requirements of this order, Buyer will have the right to reject it, to require its correction or to accept it with an adjustment in price. Any item that has been rejected\\nor required to be corrected must be replaced or corrected by and at the expense of Supplier promptly after notice. If, after being requested by Buyer, Supplier fails to promptly replace or correct any defective item,\\nthen Buyer (i) may, by contract or otherwise, replace or correct such item and charge to Supplier the cost of replacing or correcting the item, (ii) may, without further notice, cancel this purchase order for default in\\naccordance with Section 1.10 below, or (iii) may require an appropriate reduction in price.\\n1.9 CHANGE ORDERS\\n(a) The Buyer may at any time, by a written order, suspend performance hereunder, increase or decrease the ordered quantities, change the due date or make changes in any one or more of the following: (i)\\napplicable drawings, designs or specifications; (ii) method of shipment or packing; and/or (iii) place of delivery.\\n(b) If the change causes an increase in the cost or the time required by Supplier for performance of this purchase order and Supplier so notifies Buyer, then an equitable adjustment will be made in the order price or\\ndelivery schedule or both, and the purchase order will be modified accordingly in writing. No claim by Supplier for such an adjustment will be valid unless asserted within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by\\nSupplier of the notification of change; provided, however, that such period may be extended upon the written approval of Buyer.\\n(c) Nothing in this Section 1.9 is intended to excuse Supplier from proceeding with this purchase order as changed or amended.\\n1.10 CANCELLATION FOR DEFAULT\\n(a) It is understood and agreed that time is of the essence for this order because the goods or services ordered are needed for Buyer#s products that have a very short, carefully timed market life; Supplier#s failure to\\ndeliver on the due date could cause Buyer\\'s products to be unmarketable. Buyer may, by written notice, cancel this order in whole or in part if, in Buyer\\'s good-faith opinion, Supplier (i) has failed to make delivery of\\nthe items or to perform the services within the time specified herein, or any extension thereof by written change order or amendment; or (ii) has failed to replace or correct defective items in accordance with the\\nprovisions of Sections 1.7 or 1.8 above; or (iii) has failed to perform any of the other provisions of this purchase order; or (iv) has so failed to make progress under this purchase order as to endanger performance in\\naccordance with its terms.\\n(b) If this purchase order is canceled for Supplier\\'s default, Buyer may procure, upon such terms and in such manner as Buyer deems appropriate, goods or services similar or substantially similar to those canceled.\\nSupplier will then be liable to Buyer for all costs related to procuring the replacement items.\\n(c) If all or a portion of this purchase order is canceled for Supplier\\'s default, Buyer may require Supplier to transfer title and to deliver to Buyer, in the manner and to the extent directed by Buyer, (i) all completed\\nitems not yet delivered and (ii) any partially completed items and materials that Supplier has produced or acquired for the performance of the terminated portion. Supplier will, upon direction of Buyer, protect and\\npreserve the property listed in this paragraph that is in Supplier#s possession. Payment for completed items delivered to and accepted by Buyer under this paragraph will be in an amount (not to exceed the contract\\nprice) agreed upon by Supplier and Buyer; however, Supplier\\'s obligation to carry out Buyer\\'s direction as to delivery, protection, and preservation of the property will not be contingent upon prior agreement as to\\nsuch amount.\\n(d) Nothing in this Section 1.10 is intended to excuse Supplier from proceeding with any non-canceled portion of this purchase order.\\n1.11 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE\\n(a) At any time for convenience, Buyer may terminate work under this purchase order, in whole or in part, by written notice, including fax or email.\\n(b) Upon such termination, Supplier will, to the extent and at the times specified by Buyer, stop all work under this purchase order, place no further orders for materials to complete the work, assign to Buyer all\\nSupplier\\'s interests under terminated subcontracts and orders, settle all claims hereunder after obtaining Buyer\\'s approval, protect all property in which Buyer has or may acquire an interest, and transfer title and\\nmake delivery to Buyer of all articles, materials, work in process, and other things held or acquired by Supplier in connection with the terminated portion of this purchase order. Supplier will proceed promptly to\\ncomply with Buyer\\'s instructions respecting each of the foregoing without awaiting settlement or payment of its termination claim.\\n(c) Within six (6) months after such termination, Supplier may submit to Buyer its written claim for termination charges, in the form and with the certifications prescribed by Buyer. Failure to submit the claim within six\\nmonths will constitute a waiver of all claims and a release of all Buyer\\'s liability arising out of the termination.\\n(d) The parties may agree upon the amount to be paid Supplier for such termination. If they fail to agree, Buyer will pay Supplier the following amounts: (i) The contract price for all items completed or services\\nrendered in accordance with this purchase order and not previously paid for. (ii) The actual costs incurred by Supplier which are properly allocable under recognized commercial accounting practices to the\\nterminated portion of this purchase order, plus a fair and reasonable profit on such costs. If it appears that Supplier would have sustained a loss on the order, no profit will be allowed, and an adjustment will be made\\nreducing the amount of the settlement to reflect the indicated rate of loss. (iii) The reasonable costs incurred by Supplier in making settlement hereunder and in protecting property in which Buyer has or may acquire\\nan interest.\\n(e) Payments made under Sections 1.11(d)(i) and (ii) above may not exceed the aggregate price specified in this purchase order less payments otherwise made or to be made. Any amounts payable for property lost,\\ndamaged, stolen or destroyed prior to delivery to Buyer will be excluded from amounts otherwise payable to Supplier under this Section 1.11.\\n1.12 RISK OF LOSS OR DAMAGE\\nNotwithstanding any prior inspections and irrespective of the delivery point named herein, Supplier will bear all risk of loss, damage or destruction to the ordered goods until final acceptance of the goods by Buyer at\\ndestination. Supplier will bear the same risk with respect to any goods rejected by Buyer. Buyer, however, will be responsible for any loss occasioned by the gross negligence of its employees acting within the scope\\nof their employment.\\n1.13 WAIVER\\nBuyer#s failure to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this purchase order, to exercise any election or option provided herein, or to require at any time the performance by Supplier of any of the provisions\\nherein will not in any way be construed to be a waiver of such provisions.\\n1.14 REMEDIES\\nThe remedies stated herein are in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.\\n1.15 INDEMNIFICATION\\n(a) Supplier agrees to defend and indemnify Buyer, its agents, customers, successors, and assigns against any loss, damage, and liability (including attorneys# fee and other costs and expenses) for actual or\\nalleged infringement of any patent, copyright or trademark arising out of the use or sale of the goods by Buyer, its agents or customers -- provided, however, that Buyer must notify Supplier of any suit, claim or\\ndemand involving such infringement and permit Supplier to defend against or settle the same. If any injunction is issued as the result of any such infringement, Supplier agrees, at Buyer\\'s option, to (i) refund to Buyer\\nthe amounts paid to Supplier for the goods covered by the injunction, or (ii) furnish Buyer with acceptable and non-infringing goods.\\n(b) Supplier agrees to indemnify Buyer against any and all liability and expense resulting from any alleged defect in the goods, whether latent or patent, including allegedly improper construction and design, or from\\nthe failure of the goods to comply with specifications.\\n(c) Supplier warrants that there are no liabilities for royalties, mechanic#s liens or other encumbrances on the goods supplied and agrees to indemnify Buyer against any such liabilities.\\n(d) The above indemnification obligations are in addition to all other remedies of Buyer against Supplier.\\n1.16 NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL MATTER'),\n",

A forecast of changes planned for the next rolling six-month period should be provided quarterly to Silicon Labs.\\n2.4 Manufacture Discontinuance\\nSupplier will comply with JEDEC J-STD-48 Product Discontinuance requirements.  If Supplier intends to discontinue the manufacture and sale of Product, then Supplier will provide Silicon Labs with at least six (6)\\nmonths advance written notice of such discontinuance (\"EOL Notice Period#) during which time Silicon Labs may place last time buy orders for such discontinued Product provided that the date for delivery of such\\ndiscontinued Product will not be more than one year from the beginning of the EOL Notice Period.   If Supplier is unable, due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, to provide such EOL Notice Period,\\nSupplier will notify Silicon Labs in writing and immediately make available for sale a functionally equivalent Product (i.e. a product meeting the then-current Specifications for the original Product with the same form, fit\\nand function) at a price not to exceed the original Product purchase price.\\n2.5 PREFERRED Pricing.\\nSupplier covenants and agrees that the prices at which the Products are offered for sale to Silicon Labs will be no higher than the prices at which the same Products are offered to Supplier#s other customers for\\nsimilar quantities.\\n2.6 Epidemic Condition\\nAn \"Epidemic Condition# is a systemic deficiency of a Product that causes increased failure rates within Supplier#s or Silicon Labs# process and/or a field failure rate that is five times (5x) the steady state rate, or\\n1%, whichever is lower.  Silicon Labs will notify Supplier in writing immediately in the event it believes an Epidemic Condition has occurred with a Product sold to Silicon Labs and Supplier will notify Silicon Labs in\\nwriting immediately (but no later than two business days) in the event that Supplier becomes aware that a Product sold to Silicon Labs evidences an Epidemic Condition.  Supplier will utilize the Eight Discipline (8D)\\nformat for communication to Silicon Labs.  Upon such notification (either to or from Silicon Labs), notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any agreement between Silicon Labs and Supplier, Silicon Labs will have\\nthe right to postpone further shipments of the applicable Product, without liability or penalty, by written notice to Supplier until the issue causing the Epidemic Condition has been satisfactorily corrected and the failure\\nrate has returned to nominal levels. The parties agree to work together in good faith to develop and implement a containment and corrective action plan with respect to an Epidemic Condition.  Supplier will pay the\\ndirect costs of implementing the remedy to an Epidemic Condition including without limitation (a) the costs of repairing, replacing, or recalling the Products or Silicon Labs# products and (b) the reasonable field\\nreplacement costs incurred by Silicon Labs or Silicon Labs# customers as a consequence of the Epidemic Failure.  This section will survive termination or expiration of this agreement until the expiration of Silicon\\nLabs# warranties to its customers, and shall apply to all Products sold to Silicon Labs as of the date of the occurrence of the Epidemic Condition.\\n2.7 Social and Environmental Requirements and Product Compliance\\nSupplier will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture and supply of Products, including but not limited to relevant environmental regulations. Supplier will ensure its products meet the\\nrequirements of the current version of Silicon Labs# specification SR2001(including but not limited to EU RoHS, EU REACH, EU PFOS and JIG101) and its declaration and reporting scheme.   Supplier shall employ\\na documented registered ISO14001 environmental management system, with a scope that includes the Products sold to Silicon Labs.  Supplier shall employ a health and safety system in conformance with current\\nrevision of OHSAS 18001 and a social accountability system in conformance with current revision of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct.\\n2.8 Quality Requirements\\nSupplier shall employ a documented registered ISO/TS 16949 quality system that ensures process control and continual improvement throughout both direct and support functions for all processes that contribute to\\nthe receipt, production, handling, storage, distribution and servicing of Product produced for use by Silicon Labs. Supplier shall maintain a failure analysis and corrective action system that meets the requirements of\\nJEDEC J-STD-671 (current revision), including schedules for Urgent and Standard requests. When requested, Supplier shall maintain and provide a Continual Improvement Plan that defines specific projects,\\nactivities, and metrics that demonstrate improvement of Supplier#s performance as assessed by Silicon Labs# Strategic Business Review or systems assessment, or by Supplier#s self assessment. Annually,\\nSupplier will either conduct a self-assessment of its Quality, Environmental, and Social Accountability systems and performance or allow Silicon Labs or its agent to provide such assessment. Supplier shall provide\\nregular (monthly or quarterly, as requested by Silicon labs) production performance assessments of \"critical-to-quality# characteristics (as mutually agreed to by Supplier and Silicon Labs), in the form or CpK reports\\nor other metrics as approved by Silicon Labs.  For CpK measurements, the approved CpK level is 1.5 minimum.  Supplier shall submit corrective actions plans for critical-to-quality characteristics that do not achieve\\na CpK of 1.5 minimally.  Continual improvement plans are required for any critical-to-quality quality characteristics that do not achieve a CpK of 1.67 or greater. For new products, Supplier shall provide a qualification\\nreport packet of information as defined by Silicon Labs before Silicon Labs considers the part approved for Initial Production.  The qualification performed by Supplier shall support Silicon Labs product qualifications\\nwhich are based on JEDEC J-STD-47 for standard Products and AEC-100 for automotive Products. When requested by Silicon Labs or its agent to provide an \"automotive# grade part or materials that contribute to\\nan automotive part, Supplier shall also agree to provide the standard support expected of an automotive customer, including all records required by ISO/TS 16949 (current version) and the Core Tools.  These include\\nbut are not limited to records from Production Part Approval Process (PPAP), Statistical Process Control (SPC), Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA), Control Plans, and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis\\n(FMEA). Supplier shall ensure that each part or material is traceable throughout its process, both forward to its customers and backward to its suppliers.

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'TEXT_FILE.txt'}, page_content='William Shakespeare[a] (c. 23[b] April 1564 – 23 April 1616)[c] was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world\\'s pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England\\'s national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\\n\\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner (\"sharer\") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain\\'s Men, later known as the King\\'s Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare\\'s private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.\\n\\nShakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) such as The Winter\\'s Tale and The Tempest, and collaborated with other playwrights.\\n\\nMany of Shakespeare\\'s plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare\\'s, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare\\'s dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, who hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: \"not of an age, but for all time\".\\n\\nShakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family.[3] He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George\\'s Day.[1] This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616.[4][5] He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.[6]\\n\\nAlthough no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King\\'s New School in Stratford,[7][8][9] a free school chartered in 1553,[10] about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree,[11][12] and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.[13]\\n\\nAt the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway\\'s neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.[14] The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times,[15][16] and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583.[17] Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585.[18] Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.\\n\\nAfter the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the \"complaints bill\" of a law case before the Queen\\'s Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589.[20] Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare\\'s \"lost years\".[21] Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare\\'s first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him.[22][23] Another 18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London.[24] John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster.[25] Some 20th-century scholars suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain \"William Shakeshafte\" in his will.[26][27] Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area.[28][29]\\n\\nLondon and theatrical career\\nIt is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.[30] By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit from that year:\\n\\n... there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger\\'s heart wrapped in a Player\\'s hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.[31]\\n\\nScholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene\\'s words,[31][32] but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called \"University Wits\").[33] The italicised phrase parodying the line \"Oh, tiger\\'s heart wrapped in a woman\\'s hide\" from Shakespeare\\'s Henry VI, Part 3, along with the pun \"Shake-scene\", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene\\'s target. As used here, Johannes Factotum (\"Jack of all trades\") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common \"universal genius\".[31][34]\\n\\nGreene\\'s attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare\\'s work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene\\'s remarks.[35][36][37] After 1594, Shakespeare\\'s plays were performed at The Theatre, in Shoreditch, only by the Lord Chamberlain\\'s Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London.[38] After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King\\'s Men.[39]\\n\\nIn 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare\\'s property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man,[41] and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.[42]\\n\\nSome of Shakespeare\\'s plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages.[43][44][45] Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson\\'s Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603).[46] The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson\\'s Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.[35] The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of \"the Principal Actors in all these Plays\", some of which were first staged after Volpone, although one cannot know for certain which roles he played.[47] In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that \"good Will\" played \"kingly\" roles.[48] In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet\\'s father.[49] Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It, and the Chorus in Henry V,[50][51] though scholars doubt the sources of that information.[52]\\n\\nThroughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St Helen\\'s, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames.[53][54] He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.[53][55] By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul\\'s Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of women\\'s wigs and other headgear.\\n\\nNicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Samuel Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford \"some years before his death\".[58][59] He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers\\' petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King\\'s Men \"placed men players\" there, \"which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.\".[60] However, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609.[61][62] The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610),[63] which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.[64] Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614.[58] In 1612, he was called as a witness in Bellott v Mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy\\'s daughter, Mary.[65][66] In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory;[67] and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall.[68] After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.[69] His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher,[70] who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King\\'s Men. He retired in 1613, before the Globe Theatre burned down during the performance of Henry VIII on 29 June.[69]\\n\\nShakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52.[e] He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in \"perfect health\". No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: \"Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted\",[72][73] not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: \"We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went\\'st so soon / From the world\\'s stage to the grave\\'s tiring room.\\n')]"
